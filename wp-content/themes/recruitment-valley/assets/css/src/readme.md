# Main file

The main file should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. All the files here should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

### WordPress

If you make a style for a WordPress dashboard or a page that just used by backend, please use prefix `wp-` to the file name, just to make thing much more clearer :))
